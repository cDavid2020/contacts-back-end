Q: When is a space required in between curly brackets?ðŸ‘†

A: In JavaScript, a space is required in between curly brackets {} when defining an object property. In the code you provided, a space is included before and after the colon in the first object property (fullName), but not in the second object property (username). It is a good practice to include a space before and after the colon for improved readability. So the correct way is fullName: { type: String, required: true }, username: {type: string, required: true, unique: true}
